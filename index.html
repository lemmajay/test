			    <h2>"Wannabe In LA"</h2>

					<p>
					I came to L.A. to be rock and roll,
					Along the way I had to sell my soul,
					I made some good friends that make me say,
					I really wannabe in L.A.

					I took the time to get to beverly,
					Laid some rockettape roll on the 180
					Allen and Natasha always make me say,
					I really wannabe in L.A.

					(I really wannabe in L.A wahahoo)
					(I really wannabe in L.A wahahoo)
					(I really wannabe in L.A wahahoo)

					I take the city in the dead of night,
					I'm burning gas until I feel alright,
					The sunset honeys always make me say,
					I really wannabe in L.A.

					I came to L.A. to be rock and roll,
					along the way I had to sell my soul,
					I made some good friends that make me say,
					I really wannabe in L.A.
					I really wannabe in L.A.
					I really wannabe, really wannabe, really wannabe in L.A.</p>

					<h2>"To All Of You"</h2>

					<p>
					To all of you
					American girls, its sad to
					imagine a world without you
					American girls I'd like to
					be part of the world around you
					driving a car by the seaside
					watching the world from the bright side
					To all of you, American girls in the movies
					No one can tell where your heart is
					American girls like dollies
					With shiny smiles and plastic bodies
					I wish I had an American girlfriend

					I cry sometimes walking around my own place
					Wondering why she cries sometimes
					Talking about her own place
					Somewhere around the mountains
					No one could dry her fountain
					Till she got tired to complain
					That's when I fly to the wildland, to your land</p>
